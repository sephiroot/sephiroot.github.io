    <img src="assets/betPage.png"/>
    <p>
        1) Countdown: bet for the race must be submitted before the countdown expires. If you won't bet on time
        there will be a <b>-5 points</b> penalty for the race and last race's bet will be inherited for the upcoming
        one. It is possible to submit your bet <b>up to 1 hour before qualifying.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        2) Date and name of the upcoming race
    </p>
    <p>
        3) Status of the bet: it could be
    <p><span style="background-color: red; color: black"> invalid</span>: there is something wrong with your bet;
        you must fix all the errors to enable saving.</p>
    <p><span style="background-color: yellow; color: black"> unsaved </span>: meaning that something changed from your
        last save, and you must save again if you do not want to lose your changes.
    </p>
    <p>No status indicator means that bet is correct and saved.</p>
    <p>
        4) Captain status indicator: you must select your captain before each race. If the captain manages to complete
        the race
        against his teammate it will grant <b>+2 points</b> to the team. Captain is mandatory, a red indicator means you
        still must pick one.

    </p>
    <p>
        5) Captain selector: click on the name to select you captain. You can switch by clicking on the other driver's
        name.
    </p>
    <p>
        6) Bet status indicator: if red it means there are errors in yout bets.
    <p> Betting rules:</p>
    <p> - Grid/Race/Sprint (if available) are mandatory</p>
    <p> - Grid/Race/Sprint must be numbers (up to 2 digits) from 1 to 20 included</p>
    <p> - You cannot bet the result for both drivers (e.g. it is not possible to insert 17 on grid
        for both drivers)</p>
    <p>
        The status indicator will stay red as long as there is something wrong with the bets.
    </p>
    <p>
        7-8) Betting lines: here you put your numbers for each driver, the icon on the red will turn into red if the bet
        is not correct.
    </p>
    <p>
        9) Helper text: when visible it will inform you about duplicated bets on your screen.
    </p>
    <p>
        10) Save button: use this button to save your bet. The icon will inform you about the status of your bet:
    <p></p>
    <img src="assets/save.png"/>
    <p>Bet is valid and can be saved.</p>
    <img src="assets/invalidBet.png"/>

    <img src="assets/outOfTime.png"/>
